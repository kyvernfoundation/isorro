# Translation ðŸ’¬
When you're surfing the web, or even in the real world, you'll come across other languages. You can take your time to learn each language, or you can use the best tools available.
## DeepL
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) displays the best translation results. Because it uses artificial intelligence.

DeepL also offers excellent data protection.

### DeepL is the best translator available at the moment, but the free version has certain limitations.
The trick to continuing to use it for free without being restricted:
Open DeepL as a private browser. And when DeepL prompts you to pay, delete cookies, refresh the page. And the problem is solved.

## Firefox Translations
The [Firefox Translations extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/) has the advantage of translating whatever you want while remaining entirely on your computer. Nothing is sent over the Internet.
> For your safety and privacy, this is preferable.

## Reverso
In addition to translation, [Reverso](https://www.reverso.net) includes a spelling and conjugation checker. So it can complement your favorite translator.
