# Browser
It may seem contradictory to recommend Firefox and Microsoft Edge at the same time. We understand that, and we're looking for the right balance to get the best for every use and every surfer. Each browser has its own purpose, its own way of being used, and you can be the best if you use the best tools.
## Firefox
You want the best browser that respects your data and privacy.

At Mozilla, the privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.
## Microsoft Edge
You want the best boat for surfing the web: Copilot artificial intelligence and a host of other practical functions are built in.

## In summary
Firefox is best for privacy, while Microsoft Edge is best for built-in features.
